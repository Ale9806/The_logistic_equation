In this jupyter notebook we will explore the logistic equation and how it is related to a subset of the Mandelbrot set called the bifurcation diagram. It is recomended to first watch [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&t=540s) In order to understand this jupyter notebook better, since this  notebook was inspired by that video.

If you wish to know more about the mandlebrot set I recommend the following video [Mandelbrot Set -Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk)

If you find any errors, feel free to create a pull request, I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
